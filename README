Prospect version 0.92
=====================

Prospect:: is an application programmer interface (API) to the PROSPECT Pro threading application.
The modules provide for program execution, results parsing, multiple sequence alignments inferred 
from pairwise sequence-structure alignments, and rudimentary homology models.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
	 <configure the Prospect::Init module>
   make test
   make install

CONFIGURATION

After installation,
1) configure the Prospect::Init module with your system specifics.
2) run the bin/processPdbFiles script to generate processed PDB files.  These processed files are necessary
for generating rudimentary backbone-only homology models in PDB format by mapping the aligned residues onto the 3D template.
Make sure that you have defined the PROSPECT_PATH, PDB_PATH, and PROCESSED_PDB_PATH variables correctly within the
Prospect::Init module.

Something akin to this bash command will build all of processed PDB files.
	export PROSPECT_PATH=<top-level of your prospect install>;
	find $PROSPECT_PATH -name \*.xml | 
	sed -e 's/^.*\///;s/\.xml$//' | 
	xargs perl -I ../.. processPdbFiles


DEPENDENCIES
This module requires these other modules and libraries:

- XML::Parser, XML::Simple, Digest::MD5 (available from http://www.cpan.org) and bioperl (http://www.bioperl.org). 

- For remote threading, SOAP::Lite (http://www.soaplite.com/) and SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon (http://www.cpan.org) are required. 
- Colorized multiple sequence alignments requires mview (http://mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/~nbrown/mview/). 
- Viewing sequence-structure alignments requires rasmol (http://www.openrasmol.org/).
